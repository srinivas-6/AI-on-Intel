# AI-on-Intel
## AI from Data Center to the Edge - An optimized path using Intel Architecture

## Objective

Using Intel hardware and sofware portfolio for demonstarting the Data Science process. Hands on understanding of building a Deep Learning model and deploying to the Edge.


* Using the concept of Transfer Learning for Image classification problem
* Data analysis on Vehicle Make and Model Recognition (VMMR) dataset
* Training three different frameworks (Inception V3, VGG and MobileNet) on Intel Dev cloud
* Obtaining the graph and weights of the trained networks
* Evaluation of the models and freezing the graphs obtained
* Deployment to the Edge using Intel OpenVINO Toolkit 

For Setting up the Environment on your workstation or Intel AI Devcloud refer to 

## Exploratory Data Analysis
