### Preparing for training using the Keras with TensorFlow as a backend with folowing topologies
 
- Inception v3
- VGG16
- MobileNet

Initiate the training and learn about the relationship between accuracy and loss, Comparing the performance of the three Neural Networks. Evaluation and testing on a sample image and then freezing the model for use outside Keras.
